"""Pin a dataset by checksum, check a copy against the pin, fetch what is absent.

The pin is a list with one line per file: relative path, size, SHA-256. It is
committed gzipped under `checksums/`, because 100,000 files of hashes come to
about 15 MB as text. Per-file hashes are kept rather than per-directory ones
so that a check can name every file that differs. The gzip is written with a
fixed timestamp, so the same list always gives the same bytes.

The root hash is the SHA-256 of the list's uncompressed text, lines sorted by
path. It names the dataset in `run.json` and `data_quality.json`.
