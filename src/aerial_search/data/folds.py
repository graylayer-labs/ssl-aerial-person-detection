"""Leave-one-site-day-out folds over the prepared WiSARD manifests.

The unit that never crosses a split is the site-day: every clip recorded at one
site on one date. Each labelled site-day is the test set of one fold; the
other site-days supply training, validation, and the unlabelled pool. A site-day
with no labels is never a test set and is unlabelled data in every fold. The
design and its evidence are in docs/site-folds-review.md.

Every record carries ``frame``, its time in the clip counted in RGB frame
numbers (a thermal frame number minus the clip's thermal offset), so frames of
the two cameras are compared on one clock.

Layout written under the destination::

    folds.json                      settings, validation sources, counts
    <site-day>/unlabelled.jsonl     pairs for self-supervised learning
    <site-day>/<view>/train_<p>pct.jsonl, validation.jsonl, test.jsonl

Views: ``paired`` (pairs labelled in both cameras), ``rgb``, ``thermal``.
